# Remove Microsoft Bloat

This script removes unwanted and useless applications from the current profile, other user profiles and the default profile that is used to create new users.
This can result in substantially reduced first time login times, particularly on conventional hard drive Windows installations.

Additionally, a registry key is added to disable start menu ads for all users, known in the Microsoft world as 'Consumer Experience'.


Note: This will not remove manually added app such as Candy Crush if the user has already opened them.
All applications removed can be reinstalled via the microsoft store.
